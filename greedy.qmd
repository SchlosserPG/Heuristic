# Optimization Problem

-   Sometimes, we go with the ‘greedy’ option that seems best in the moment. Can you think of a time when you made a quick decision like that? Did it pay off or backfire?

## Definition 1

-   An optimization problem $P$ is to find the optimal value, possibly subject to some constraints, out of all possible solutions.

-   Contains the *objective function*, *constraint(s)*, and *solution*.

-   $opt_{s \in A} f(s)$ subject to $\forall c_i(s) \odot b_i, i=i, 2, ...,m$ where

-   opt is either min (for minimization) or max (for maximization),

    -   s is a candidate solution
    -   A and B are the domain and codomain of the problem Image, namely, A is the set of all possible solutions and B is the set of all possible outcomes of the objective function,
    -   $c_i(s) \odot b_i$ is the constraint, and
    -   $f(s): A->B$ is the objective function
    -   $\odot$ is $>, <, =, <=, >=$

## Definition 2

-   The optimal solution is a solution, out of all feasible candidate solutions of the optimization problem $P$, that gives the optimal value. $f(s^*) = \operatorname{opt} \{f(s)\}, \, \forall \, c_i(s) \, \odot \, b_i, \, i = 1, 2, \dots, m.$

To compare $f(s)$ with $f(s^*)$, $f(s)$ represents the objective function evaluated at a solution $s$. $f(s^*)$ refers to the optimal solution, where $s^*$ is the best candidate that optimizes $f(s)$ (either maximizing or minimizing it).

## Definition 3

-   If the optimal solution $s*$ for the problem 𝑃 exists, then the optimal value $f^*$ is defined as $min_{s \in A} f(s)$, subject to $\forall c_i(s) \odot b_i$,
-   While the maximization problem of maximizing $f(s)$ subject to some constraints can be defined as $max_{s \in A} f(s)$, subject to $\forall c_i(s) \odot b_i$

# The Greedy Algorithm

-   The Greedy Algorithm is a problem-solving method that makes a series of choices, each of which looks best at first, with the hope of finding a global optimum.
    -   The greedy strategy is a method of making choices, not a problem type. It can be applied to various domains, including those that are not about optimizing an objective function over a combinatorial set.
    -   It's typically used for optimization problems where local choices lead to a global solution.
-   Greedy algorithms focus on immediate benefits without backtracking.
-   Greedy algorithms are useful in scenarios where a quick, suboptimal solution is acceptable, such as in scheduling, resource allocation, and pathfinding problems
    -   Greedy Choice Property: A local optimum is chosen at each step.
    -   Optimal Substructure: A problem has an optimal solution that can be constructed from optimal solutions of its subproblems.
-   Common Problems Using Greedy Algorithm:
    -   Coin Change Problem
    -   Activity Selection Problem
    -   Traveling Salesman Problem

## Simple Example of Greedy Algorithm in Action

-   The Coin Change Problem
-   Given a set of coin denominations and a target amount, find the minimum number of coins that add up to the target amount.
-   Greedy Strategy: At each step, pick the largest denomination that doesn’t exceed the remaining amount.

$$\operatorname{coins\_used}(A) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left\lfloor \frac{A}{c_i} \right\rfloor \times c_i \quad \operatorname{where} \quad A = A - \left\lfloor \frac{A}{c_i} \right\rfloor \times c_i$$

Where $\left\lfloor \frac{A}{c_i} \right\rfloor$ is the number of coins of denomination $c_i$ is used.

$A$ is reduced by the value $\left\lfloor \frac{A}{c_i} \right\rfloor \times c_i$

After using as many $c_i$ denomination coins as possible. The process continues until $A=0$, at which point the minimum number of coins required to make the total amount is found.

```{python}
def greedy_coin_change(coins, amount):
    coins.sort(reverse=True)
    result = []
    for coin in coins:
        while amount >= coin:
            amount -= coin
            result.append(coin)
    
    # Print the coins used
    print(f"Coins used: {result}")
    
    # Return the number of coins used
    return len(result)

# Get user input (Put in 70 to show answer, but can request information from user)
amount = 70
# amount = int(input("Enter the amount: "))

# Coin denominations
coins = [1, 5, 10, 25]

# Calculate the solution
num_coins = greedy_coin_change(coins, amount)

print(f"Minimum number of coins needed: {num_coins}")

```

# Types of Optimization Problems

-   The optimization problems we are facing can be classified into two categories based on the variable type of the solution space namely, solutions encoded as discrete variables and solutions encoded as continuous variables.
    -   Discrete: Referred to as the combinatorial optimization problem (COP)
        -   Looking for the best solution from a finite set—usually either a set of integer numbers or a subset, a permutation, or even a graph structure of something
    -   Continuous: Referred to as the continuous optimization problem.
        -   Looking for a set of real numbers that not only satisfy all the given constraints but also give the best solution

## Discrete vs Continuous

![Discrete vs Continuous](Pictures/ContDisc.png "Discrete vs Continuous")

### Discrete

-   Domain: The set of all possible input values for a function.
-   Codomain: The set of all potential output values that the function can map to.
-   An objective function is a function that is being optimized (maximized or minimized) in a given problem. It takes an input from the domain and produces an output in the codomain.
-   Given two sets $A$ and $B$, and an objective function $f$, we can understand how the function maps elements from the domain $A$ to the codomain $B$.

### Continuous

-   Shows the relationship between the angle θ and the value of sin⁡(θ) at specific points. This relationship arises from the trigonometric sine function, which describes a wave-like pattern that oscillates between -1 and 1.
-   θ represents the angle, typically in radians, and the values given (0, 0.25$\pi$, 0.50$\pi$, etc.) are specific points along the unit circle.
-   sin(θ) represents the sine of the angle θ, which is the y-coordinate of the corresponding point on the unit circle.
-   The values provided in the table correspond to these properties of the sine function. The function gradually increases from 0 to 1, then decreases back to 0, then continues to -1, and finally returns to 0, completing one full cycle.

# Combinatorial Optimization Problems (COPs)

-   The goal of COPs is to find the optimal solution from a finite set or a countably infinite set of solutions. The possible solutions of a COP are generally “discrete” or can be discretized.
    -   Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)
    -   The one-max
    -   0-1 knapsack problems

## Traveling Salesman Algorithm

Optimal Path: $$\min_{s \in \S_{\pi}} f(s) = \left[ \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} d\left(c_{\pi(i)}, c_{\pi(i+1)}\right) \right] + d\left(c_{\pi(n)}, c_{\pi(1)}\right)$$

Where min\_(𝑠∈𝒮_𝜋 )$c_{\pi} = \{ c_{\pi(1)}, c_{\pi(2)}, \dots, c_{\pi(n)} \}$, that is, all permutations of the $n$ cities.

vs.

Nearest Neighbor (Greedy): $Z = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} c_{i, \text{NN}(i)} + c_{n, \text{NN}(1)}$

### Greedy TSP Solution using Nearest Neighbor

-   Start at Richmond. Find the nearest city. From Richmond, the nearest city is Petersburg (25 miles). Move to Petersburg.

-   From Petersburg, find the nearest unvisited city, which is Newport News (65 miles). Move to Newport News .

-   From Newport News, the nearest unvisited city is Norfolk (30 miles). Move to Norfolk.

-   From Norfolk, the nearest unvisited city is Chesapeake (10 miles).Move to Chesapeake.

-   From Chesapeake, the only unvisited city left is Virginia Beach (15 miles). Move to Virginia Beach.

-   Finally, return to Richmond from Virginia Beach (100 miles).

-   Richmond -\> Petersburg -\> Newport News -\> Norfolk -\> Chesapeake -\> Virginia Beach -\> Richmond

-   Total distance traveled: = 25+65+30+10+15+100 = 245 miles

# TSP Python Implementation

# Dictionary vs Dictionary of Dictionaries

-   A dictionary in Python is a built-in data structure that stores data in key-value pairs. It is unordered, mutable, and indexed by unique keys. The structure is enclosed within curly braces {}. Each key is associated with a value, and the two are separated by a colon :. Keys must be immutable types like strings, numbers, or tuples, while values can be of any data type, including other dictionaries.

```{python}
my_dict = {
     "key1": "value1",
     "key2": "value2",
     "key3": "value3"
}
```

-   A dictionary of dictionaries is a nested data structure in Python where the values of a dictionary are themselves dictionaries. It allows for organizing hierarchical or complex data in a structured way. This type of dictionary is especially useful for representing relationships, groupings, or matrices where each primary key maps to another dictionary of key-value pairs.

-   A distance matrix or distance map is helpful in implementing a TSP model in python can use the dictionary of dictionaries structure in python to implement. A distance map stores the distances between each pair of locations.

    -   Outer Dictionary: Each key represents a city.
    -   Inner Dictionary: Contains distances to other cities from that city.

```{python}
distances = {
     'City1': {'City2': 5, 'City3': 10},
     'City2': {'City1': 5, 'City3': 8},
     'City3': {'City1': 10, 'City2': 8}
}
```

-   Each key (e.g., 'City1') represents a location. Each inner dictionary provides distances to the other cities.

```{python}

# Define the cities and distances between them
cities = ['Richmond', 'Petersburg', 'Chesapeake', 'Norfolk', 'Newport News', 'Virginia Beach']

# Distances matrix (symmetric)
distances = {
     'Richmond': {'Petersburg': 25, 'Chesapeake': 95, 'Norfolk': 92, 'Newport News': 70, 'Virginia Beach': 100},
     'Petersburg': {'Richmond': 25, 'Chesapeake': 85, 'Norfolk': 87, 'Newport News': 65, 'Virginia Beach': 90},
     'Chesapeake': {'Richmond': 95, 'Petersburg': 85, 'Norfolk': 10, 'Newport News': 40, 'Virginia Beach': 15},
     'Norfolk': {'Richmond': 92, 'Petersburg': 87, 'Chesapeake': 10, 'Newport News': 30, 'Virginia Beach': 18},
     'Newport News': {'Richmond': 70, 'Petersburg': 65, 'Chesapeake': 40, 'Norfolk': 30, 'Virginia Beach': 45},
     'Virginia Beach': {'Richmond': 100, 'Petersburg': 90, 'Chesapeake': 15, 'Norfolk': 18, 'Newport News': 45}
}

start_city = 'Richmond'

# Function to find the nearest neighbor
def find_nearest_neighbor(current_city, unvisited):
     nearest_city = None
     min_distance = float('inf')
     for city in unvisited:
          if distances[current_city][city] < min_distance:
               min_distance = distances[current_city][city]
          nearest_city = city
     return nearest_city, min_distance

# Nearest Neighbor algorithm implementation
def nearest_neighbor_tsp(start_city):
     unvisited = cities.copy()
     unvisited.remove(start_city)
     current_city = start_city
     route = [start_city]
     total_distance = 0
    
     while unvisited:
          next_city, distance = find_nearest_neighbor(current_city, unvisited)
          route.append(next_city)
          total_distance += distance
          current_city = next_city
          unvisited.remove(current_city)
    
     # Return to the starting city
     total_distance += distances[current_city][start_city]
     route.append(start_city)
    
     return route, total_distance

# Running the algorithm starting from Richmond
route, total_distance = nearest_neighbor_tsp(start_city)

# Output the result
print("Optimal route using Nearest Neighbor:", " -> ".join(route))
print("Total distance traveled:", total_distance, "miles")


```

# Adding Constraints

-   A constraint is a rule that limits which edges or routes you are allowed to take.
-   In our algorithm, we can use a restricted edge is an edge we prefer not to use. In this case, we only use restricted edges when no unrestricted options remain.
-   Constraints change the behavior of the heuristic
-   The algorithm must prioritize legal/unrestricted moves
-   Restricted moves are only used when no legal options remain
-   A tuple represents one specific directed edge (“S", “C") and in this case a restricted edge. A tuple is perfect for this because it stores exactly two items in a fixed order: the starting node and the ending node.

* When we add a candidate move, we store it as a tuple: (distance, is_restricted, neighbor). Each part has a specific meaning:
     -   distance (d): how far the move is
     -   is_restricted (True/False): whether we should avoid this edge
     -   neighbor (name): where we would go next

* min() normally compares entire values. But our values are tuples, not just numbers. So instead of comparing (distance, is_restricted, neighbor_name) directly, we tell min() to only look at the first item in each tuple (the distance) when deciding which is smallest.

```{python}
# Nearest Neighbor with one restricted edge:
# Avoid S -> C unless all other options are visited.

dist = {
    "S": {"S": 0, "A": 4, "B": 6, "C": 2},
    "A": {"S": 4, "A": 0, "B": 3, "C": 5},
    "B": {"S": 6, "A": 3, "B": 0, "C": 4},
    "C": {"S": 2, "A": 5, "B": 4, "C": 0},
}

# Define the restricted edge written as a set of tuple pair. 
restricted_edges = {("S", "C")}

def nearest_neighbor_with_constraint(start):
    current = start
    visited = {start}
    route = [start]
    total_distance = 0

    while len(visited) < len(dist):
        candidates = [] 

        # Look at all neighbors we haven’t visited yet and skip places we have visited
        for neighbor, d in dist[current].items(): 
            if neighbor in visited or neighbor == current:
                continue
            # Check if the edge (or road) is restricted
            is_restricted = (current, neighbor) in restricted_edges
            # Adding this neighbor as a possible next step --- making a tuple with (distance, is_restricted, neighbor_name)
            candidates.append((d, is_restricted, neighbor)) 
        # separate restricted from unrestricted, preferring moves that are not restricted
        unrestricted = [c for c in candidates if not c[1]] 

        if unrestricted:
            # choose nearest unrestricted
            # Remember that a lambda is just a tiny, one-line function you write inside another command.
            # In this case give n a candidate x, return its distance value x[0]
            d, _, nxt = min(unrestricted, key=lambda x: x[0])
            #Because every candidate is stored like this:(distance, is_restricted, 
            # neighbor_name); x[0] = the distance; x[1] =whether restricted, and 
            # x[2] = the neighbor name
        else:
            # must choose restricted (last resort)
            d, _, nxt = min(candidates, key=lambda x: x[0])
        
        #Move there and update the route
        route.append(nxt)
        visited.add(nxt)
        total_distance += d
        current = nxt

    # After all stops, return to the start
    route.append(start)
    total_distance += dist[current][start]

    return route, total_distance


# Run the algorithm
route, total = nearest_neighbor_with_constraint("S")

print("Route:", " -> ".join(route))
print("Total distance:", total)

#### Note min() normally compares entire values. But our values are tuples, not just numbers. 
# So instead of comparing (distance, is_restricted, neighbor_name) directly, we tell min() 
# to only look at the first item in each tuple (the distance) when deciding which is smallest.

# Using AI

-   Use the following prompt on a generative AI, like chatGPT, to learn more about the topics covered.
-   Greedy Decisions: Think of a real-world example where you made a "greedy" choice (choosing the option that seemed best at the moment). Did it lead to the best possible outcome? Why or why not?
-   Optimization Problems: Explain the difference between discrete and continuous optimization problems. Give a real-world example of each type.
-   Coin Change Problem: Implement the greedy_coin_change function from the slides. Then, modify it to handle cases where the denominations do not lead to an optimal solution. Explain the changes made.
-   Nearest Neighbor TSP: Given a distance matrix for a Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), write Python code using the greedy nearest neighbor approach. Compare its solution to the optimal path for the same problem.
-   Greedy Limitations: Discuss a problem where a greedy algorithm does not guarantee the optimal solution. How could this limitation be addressed (e.g., using dynamic programming or exhaustive search)?
-   Practical Scenarios: Discuss a real-world system (e.g., ride-sharing, network routing, or resource allocation) where greedy algorithms are used. What trade-offs do they involve?
-   Designing a Greedy Algorithm: Create your own optimization problem and solve it using a greedy algorithm. Explain your reasoning and solution step-by-step.

# Conclusions

-   While greedy algorithms can provide optimal solutions for certain problems (e.g., fractional knapsack), they don't always guarantee an optimal result for all problems. Understanding when to use them is key.
-   Greedy algorithms guarantee an optimal solution for problems that exhibit the greedy choice property. However, the Greedy Algorithm may not always yield the optimal solution. Greedy works well for certain problems like the Coin Change Problem with standard denominations.
-   Greedy algorithms can be faster and more efficient in terms of time complexity compared to other approaches (like dynamic programming or exhaustive search), especially when the problem size is large.
-   The approach is simple and efficient, making it ideal for many practical scenarios. Greedy algorithms typically use less memory because they do not need to store all possible solutions or intermediate results, unlike dynamic programming or exhaustive search methods.
