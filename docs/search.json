This can lead to discriminatory outcomes, such as misidentifying people of color at higher rates than white individuals.\nImpact: This bias can result in wrongful accusations or the exclusion of certain groups from services that rely on facial recognition technology.\n\nHiring algorithms are used by companies to screen job applicants, but they can unintentionally perpetuate biases present in the training data.\n\nA famous case involved an AI hiring tool developed by Amazon, which was found to be biased against female applicants. The algorithm was trained on resumes submitted over the previous decade, which were predominantly from male applicants, leading the AI to favor male candidates.\nImpact: This bias can reinforce gender inequalities in the workplace by systematically disadvantaging qualified female applicants.\n\nPredictive Policing algorithms analyze historical crime data to predict where future crimes are likely to occur, influencing law enforcement patrols.\n\nThese algorithms often reflect existing biases in policing practices, such as disproportionately targeting minority neighborhoods. Because the training data may contain biased policing patterns, the algorithm can perpetuate over-policing in certain communities.\nImpact: This can lead to a cycle of increased surveillance and criminalization of specific racial or ethnic groups, reinforcing systemic biases in the criminal justice system.",

Here’s a breakdown of the function based on the np.exp command and the logic:\n\ntmp_obj_val: The objective value of a new (temporary) solution.\nobj_val: The objective value of the current solution. temperature: The current temperature in the simulated annealing process, which controls how likely the algorithm is to accept worse solutions.\nA random number r between 0 and 1 is generated. This represents a threshold for whether the new solution will be accepted using random.rand()\nThe probability p of accepting the new solution is computed using the exponential function.\nIf the random value r is less than the calculated probability p, the function returns True, meaning the new solution is accepted (even if it’s worse). If r is greater than p, the new solution is rejected, and the current solution is maintained.\n\nThe function decides whether to accept a new solution in simulated annealing, balancing exploration and exploitation based on the temperature and objective values of the solutions. The np.exp() function ensures that worse solutions have a chance to be accepted, particularly early in the process, fostering a broader search space.\n\n\n# Simulated annealing temperature decay\ndef determine(self, tmp_obj_val, obj_val, temperature):\n     r = np.random.rand()\n     p = np.exp((tmp_obj_val - obj_val) / temperature)\n     return r &lt; p",

The fitness function is used to evaluate the quality of each candidate solution in the population.\nFitness Function: Imagine life had a personal ‘fitness function’ just for you. What variables would you include in it, and how would you weigh them? If 0 meant that you were unable to satisfy that goal, and 1 meant that you were able to satisfy that goal, wouldn’t you want all 1s.\n\n\nOne Max Formula\n\nBinary String: A binary string is generated using NumPy’s randint function, which creates a list of 0s and 1s.\nFitness Function: The one_max function calculates the “fitness” of the binary string, which is simply the sum of all 1s in the string. This is the value that needs to be maximized.\nExample Run: If the generated binary string is [1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0], the fitness would be 6, since there are six 1s in the string.\nThe objective is to maximize the number of 1s in a binary string.\n\n\\[\\max_{s \\in A} f(s) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} s_i, \\quad \\text{subject to} \\ s_i \\in \\{0, 1\\}.\\]\n\n\nOptimal Solution OneMax\n\nThe optimal solution of this problem is that all the subsolutions assume the value 1; i.e., \\(s_i=1\\) for all \\(i\\).

In other words, given a solution, it is possible to check if it is correct relatively quickly (in polynomial time). However, finding the solution itself might take much longer (potentially exponential time) unless the problem can also be solved in polynomial time.\nNP-complete refers to a class of problems in computational complexity theory that are both NP (nondeterministic polynomial time) and every problem in NP can be reduced to it in polynomial time\nNP-hard problems are optimization or decision problems that are at least as difficult to solve as the hardest problems in NP (nondeterministic polynomial time).\n\nUnlike NP-complete problems, NP-hard problems do not have to be verifiable in polynomial time. This means that while it may be incredibly hard to find an optimal solution, even verifying a proposed solution might take more than polynomial time.\nEssentially, NP-hard problems are hard to solve optimally, and their complexity often prevents efficient algorithms from finding or checking solutions within a reasonable time frame.\nNP-hard problems are broader and potentially harder than NP-complete problems because they can include problems that aren’t even in NP. They may not have a polynomial-time verification process.\n\n\n\n\nKey Characteristics of NP-complete Problems\n\nDifficult to solve: No known algorithms can solve NP-complete problems efficiently (in polynomial time) for all instances.\nVerification in polynomial time: If someone provides a solution, it can be verified quickly. Equivalence to other NP-complete problems: If one NP-complete problem can be solved in polynomial time, all NP-complete problems can be solved in polynomial time.\nKnapsack Problem: The 0/1 knapsack problem is NP-complete. Finding the optimal solution is hard, but verifying if a solution meets the constraints and maximizes value can be done in polynomial time.\nThe Fractional knapsack problem is not NP-complete and can be solved in polynomial time using a greedy algorithm.\nThe Travelling Salesman is a NP-hard problem.\n\n\n\nExample Fractional Knapsack Problem\n\nItems Available: - Item 1: Value = 10, Weight = 5 kg - Item 2: Value = 40, Weight = 10 kg - Item 3: Value = 30, Weight = 15 kg\nObjective: Maximize the total value without exceeding Knapsack Capacity of 15 kg.\nThe greedy algorithm works well by prioritizing items with the highest value-to-weight ratio.\n0/1 Knapsack Problem requires more complex algorithms like dynamic programming to find the optimal solution over the Fractional Knapsack Problem\n\n\n\nGreedy Algorithm for Fractional Knapsack\n\nStep 1: Calculate Value-to-Weight Ratio:\n\nItem 1: 10/5=2\nItem 2: 40/10=4\nItem 3: 30/15=2\n\nStep 2: Sort Items by Ratio (Descending): Item 2, Item 1, Item 3\n\nStep 3: Fill the Knapsack:\nTake Item 2 (10 kg, Value = 40).\nTake as much of Item 1 as possible (5 kg, Value = 10).\n\nResults: Total Weight = 15 kg, Total Value = 50.",

It is characterized by its multi-modal nature with a nearly flat outer region and a large hole at the center.\nApplications\n\nUsed as a standard test case in evaluating the performance of optimization algorithms like genetic algorithms, simulated annealing, and particle swarm optimization.\nRelevant in fields such as machine learning, control systems, and operations research.\n\nLimitations\n\nThe function’s large search space and numerous local minima make it difficult for algorithms to converge to the global minimum.\nLarge importance of balancing exploration and exploitation in optimization strategies when dealing with the Ackley Function.\n\n\n\nExplanation of Ackley Function(x, y)\n\nComputes the value of the Ackley function given a point (x, y) in the search space.\nThe optimization algorithm optimizes the Ackley function to find the point where it reaches its minimum. It initializes a population of random solutions, evaluates their fitness (using the Ackley function), and iteratively improves them using an optimization method (like gradient descent or a genetic algorithm).\nThe best solution and corresponding function value (score) are returned as the result.\n\n\n\nAckley function and B2D: Converting to Decimal\n\nThe Ackley function uses the binary representation, where the binary strings need to be converted to decimal values (i.e., real numbers). In this case, the converted decimal values correspond to points in the continuous search space.\nFor example, a binary string like 1010 can be converted into a decimal value, which can then be used as input to the Ackley function. Binary String: 1010, where the binary number is 1010_2.\nEach position in the binary number represents a power of 2, starting from the right (least significant bit):\nThe rightmost bit (0) is \\(2^0\\),The next bit (1) is \\(2^1\\) ,The next bit (0) is \\(2^2\\),The leftmost bit (1) is \\(2^3\\).\n\n\\(1010_2= 0 ∗ 2^0+ 1 ∗ 2^1 +0 ∗ 2^2+1 ∗ 2^3\\) \\(= 0 ∗ 1+ 1 ∗ 2 + 0 ∗ 4 + 1 ∗ 8\\) \\(=  0 + 2 + 0 + 8 = 10\\) Thus, the decimal equivalent of the binary string “1010” is 10. Use this value as input for the Ackley function.\n\n\nCharacteristics and Visualization of Ackley Function\n\nThe Ackley function is evaluated in the hypercube.\nThe global optimum (minimum) of the Ackley function is 𝑓(𝑠^∗)=0 is located at \\(s^*=(0,0,…0)\\).\nThis function has many local optima, which makes it hard for the search algorithm to find the global optimum.\n\n\n\n\nAckley\n\n\n\n\nAckley Function Formula\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{rl}\n\\min_{s \\in \\mathbb{R}^n} f(s) &= -20 \\exp \\left(-0.2 \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n s_i^2} \\right) \\\\\n& \\quad - \\exp \\left( \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\cos(2 \\pi s_i) \\right) + 20 + e, \\\\\n\\text{subject to} & \\quad -30 \\leq s_i \\leq 30, \\quad i = 1, 2, \\dots, n.\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\n\nAckley Function: Pseudocode\n\nThe below example uses a random function to pull a point that we want to hit the local minima.

These results are random, so it may vary from what you see in the plot.\nDistance from the Origin: The Ackley function reaches its global minimum of 0 at the origin (i.e., when both \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\) are close to 0). Our vector values are quite far from the origin, which is why the function result is positive and relatively large at 17.9”\nThe Ackley landscape has an exponentially increasing structure as you move away from the global minimum. It has many local minima, which makes optimization algorithms prone to getting stuck in suboptimal solutions. A result like 17.9 is far from zero, and indicates that the vector is located in such a suboptimal region of the function space.\nThus, the Ackley result of 17.9 suggests that the point [12.8 3.16]; is not close to the global minimum (which is zero at the origin) and is located in a region of higher function values.\n\n\n\nDifferential Evolution with the Ackley Function\n\nTo demonstrate how an algorithm does well on the Ackley function, we can use a global optimization algorithm such as Differential Evolution, which is effective for non-convex functions with many local minima.\nDifferential Evolution is a population-based optimization algorithm used for solving complex multidimensional problems. It belongs to the family of evolutionary algorithms, where a population of candidate solutions evolves over time to find the global optimum of a function.\nThe differential_evolution function from the scipy.optimize module is a powerful optimization tool designed to solve global optimization problems. It is a type of evolutionary algorithm, which is used when the function to optimize is non-linear, has many local minima, or is not differentiable.\n\n\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import differential_evolution\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nnp.random.seed(5042)\n\n# Define the Ackley function\n# Ackley function implementation\ndef ackley(s):\n    a, b, c = 20, 0.2, 2 * np.pi\n    n = len(s)\n    sum_sq_term = np.sum(s**2)\n    cos_term = np.sum(np.cos(c * s))\n    term1 = -a * np.exp(-b * np.sqrt(sum_sq_term / n))\n    term2 = -np.exp(cos_term / n)\n    return term1 + term2 + a + np.e\n\n# Set the bounds for the variables \nbounds = [(-30, 30), (-30, 30)]\n\n# Use differential evolution to minimize the Ackley function\nresult = differential_evolution(ackley, bounds, seed=42)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(f'Optimized parameters (x1, x2): {result.x}')\nprint(f'Function value at minimum: {result.fun}')\n\n\n# Visualization of the Ackley function\nx = np.linspace(-30, 30, 400)\ny = np.linspace(-30, 30, 400)\nX, Y = np.meshgrid(x, y)\n\n# Compute Z for the Ackley function\nZ = np.array([ackley(np.array([x_val, y_val])) for x_val, y_val in zip(np.ravel(X), np.ravel(Y))])\nZ = Z.reshape(X.shape)\n\n# Plotting the Ackley function surface\nfig = plt.figure(figsize=(10, 7))\nax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection='3d')\nax.plot_surface(X, Y, Z, cmap='viridis', edgecolor='none')\n\n# Customize the plot\nax.set_title(\"Ackley Function Surface (2D)\")\nax.set_xlabel(\"s_1\")\nax.set_ylabel(\"s_2\")\nax.set_zlabel(\"f(s)\")\n\n# Show the plot\nplt.show()\n\nOptimized parameters (x1, x2): [0. 0.]\nFunction value at minimum: 4.440892098500626e-16\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing a great function that is designed to solve problems with multiple local minimums, you can see that we got extremely close to the local minimum 0.",

    "text": "Multi-objective Optimization Problem (MOP)\n\nGiven a set of functions and a set of constraints, the MOP is to find the optimal value or a set of optimal values (also called Pareto front), subject to the constraints, out of all possible solutions of these functions.\nThe Pareto front consists of solutions where no objective can be improved without worsening at least one other objective. For example, In product design, you might want to minimize cost while maximizing performance. These two objectives are often in conflict, meaning improving one leads to trade-offs in the other.\n\n\\[\\text{opt}\\left( f_1(s), f_2(s), \\dots, f_k(s) \\right),\n\\quad \\mathbf{s} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n,\n\\quad \\text{subject to } c_i(s) \\odot b_i, \\quad i = 1, 2, \\dots, m,\\]\n\nWhere\n\n\\({R}^n\\) and \\({R}\\) are the domain and codomain, respectively,\n\\(f(s) {R}^n\\) and \\({R}\\) is the objective function to be optimized,\n\\(c_i(s): {R}^n\\) and \\({R}\\odot b_i, \\quad i = 1, 2, \\ldots, m,\\) are the constraints,\nand \\(opt\\) and \\(\\odot\\) are as given in Definition 1 as &lt;, &gt;, =, ⩽, or ⩾.\n\n\n\nThe Schaffer min-min Multi-objective Optimization Problem\n\nThe Schaffer min-min problem is a well-known test function in the field of multi-objective optimization.\nIt is often used to evaluate optimization algorithms due to its simplicity and well-defined structure. The problem is particularly famous for having a simple Pareto-optimal front.\nThe Schaffer function can be defined as a two-objective optimization problem, where the objectives are functions of a single variable x.\nThe goal is to minimize both of these objective functions simultaneously.\n\n\nCharacteristics and Visualization\n\nConvexity: The Pareto front of the Schaffer min-min problem is convex, making it relatively easy to identify the trade-off surface between the two objectives.\nGraphically, the Pareto front of the Schaffer min-min problem can be visualized as a curve in the objective space, where \\(f_1(x)\\) is plotted against \\(f_2(x)\\) and the curve represents the set of optimal trade-offs between the two objectives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nscipy.optimize import minimize\n\nminimize is a general-purpose function from scipy.optimize used for finding the minimum of a scalar function.\nUses the BFGS (Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno) algorithm when no specific method is provided. This method is a quasi-Newton optimization algorithm, particularly useful for smooth unconstrained problems.\n\nIt can handle different types of optimization problems, including: Unconstrained minimization\nConstrained minimization (equality and inequality constraints) Bounded minimization (where variables are limited to a certain range)\n\nBasic Workflow:\n\nDefine the objective function (the function to minimize). Choose an initial guess for the variables.\nRun the minimize function with the desired method.\nAnalyze the results: returns optimized variables, the function value, and other diagnostic information.\n\n\n\n\nSchaffer Min-Min Formula\n\\[\n\\min_{s \\in \\mathbb{R}^n}\n\\begin{cases}\nf_1(s) = s^2, \\\\\nf_2(s) = (s - 2)^2,\n\\end{cases}\n\\quad \\text{subject to} \\quad s \\in [-10^3, 10^3].\n\\]\n\n\nSchaffer Min-Min Pseudocode\nPseudocode\n\n# FUNCTION to calculate f1(s)\nFUNCTION f1(s):\n    RETURN s^2\n\n# FUNCTION to calculate f2(s)\nFUNCTION f2(s):\n    RETURN (s - 2)^2\n\n# FUNCTION for combined objective, weighted sum of f1 and f2\nFUNCTION combined_objective(s, w1=0.5, w2=0.5):\n    RETURN w1 * f1(s) + w2 * f2(s)\n\n# MAIN EXECUTION\n# Step 1: Set up the bounds for the solution (s ∈ [-1000, 1000])\nSET bounds = [-1000, 1000]\n\n# Step 2: Initialize a starting guess for the solution\nSET initial_guess = 0\n\n# Step 3: Minimize the combined objective function using an optimization algorithm\nCALL minimize function with combined_objective, initial_guess, and bounds\nSTORE the result in result\n\n# Step 4: Print the optimization result\nPRINT \"Optimal value of s:\", result.x\nPRINT \"f1(s):\", f1(result.x)\nPRINT \"f2(s):\", f2(result.x)\nPRINT \"Combined objective:\", combined_objective(result.x)\n\n# Step 5: Visualization - Create a range of values for s from -1000 to 1000\n\n\n\nSchaffer Min-Min Python Implementation\n\nPopulation Initialization: A population of random solutions is initialized within the bounds [−1000,1000]. Objective Function Evaluation: For each solution, both objective functions are evaluated.\nScore Combination: The results of the two functions are combined into a single score, which can be minimized. In this case, the combination is a simple sum of f1 and f2.\nOptimization Loop: Iteratively updates the solutions to find the minimum combined score using an optimization technique (e.g., gradient descent, genetic algorithm).\nThe plot uses the weighted sum minimization, w1 * f1(s) + w2 * f2(s) instead of plotting the Pareto front. The plot prints The optimal \\(s\\) value and the corresponding function values \\(f1(s)\\) and \\(f2(s)\\) at that point.

When the solutions are represented as binary strings, the number of bits directly determines the size of the search space.\nWhy it matters:\n\nDefining the Search Space: The number of bits defines how many unique binary strings (or configurations) are possible. For \\(2^n\\) possible combinations. So, by setting the number of bits, you are effectively defining the boundaries of the search space.\nEnumerating All Possibilities: In exhaustive search, the algorithm needs to evaluate every possible configuration to ensure the optimal solution is found. Each unique binary string corresponds to a specific candidate solution, so having the number of bits set enables the algorithm to enumerate all possible configurations.\nComputational Complexity: The number of bits directly affects the computational complexity of exhaustive search. With \\(n\\) bits, the search space grows exponentially, which is manageable for small \\(n\\) but quickly becomes infeasible for larger \\(n\\). By controlling the number of bits, you also control the practical feasibility of the exhaustive search.\n\n\nSimplicity: Since exhaustive search doesn’t involve complex heuristics or probabilistic methods, setting the number of bits becomes the main task.
