This can lead to discriminatory outcomes, such as misidentifying people of color at higher rates than white individuals.\nImpact: This bias can result in wrongful accusations or the exclusion of certain groups from services that rely on facial recognition technology.\n\nHiring algorithms are used by companies to screen job applicants, but they can unintentionally perpetuate biases present in the training data.\n\nA famous case involved an AI hiring tool developed by Amazon, which was found to be biased against female applicants. The algorithm was trained on resumes submitted over the previous decade, which were predominantly from male applicants, leading the AI to favor male candidates.\nImpact: This bias can reinforce gender inequalities in the workplace by systematically disadvantaging qualified female applicants.\n\nPredictive Policing algorithms analyze historical crime data to predict where future crimes are likely to occur, influencing law enforcement patrols.\n\nThese algorithms often reflect existing biases in policing practices, such as disproportionately targeting minority neighborhoods. Because the training data may contain biased policing patterns, the algorithm can perpetuate over-policing in certain communities.\nImpact: This can lead to a cycle of increased surveillance and criminalization of specific racial or ethnic groups, reinforcing systemic biases in the criminal justice system.",

Specifically, it computes the base-e exponential function, which is 𝑒^𝑥, where 𝑒 is Euler’s number (approximately 2.71828), and 𝑥 is the input array or scalar.\n\n\n# Applying np.exp to the array\narray = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])\nexp_array = np.exp(array)\nprint(\"Exponential Array:\", exp_array)\n\nExponential Array: [ 2.71828183  7.3890561  20.08553692 54.59815003]\n\n\n\nnp.exp from Simulated Annealing example\nThis function is part of a Simulated Annealing algorithm, specifically handling the temperature decay mechanism to decide whether to accept a new solution, even if it’s worse than the current one. Here’s a breakdown of the function based on the np.exp command and the logic:\n\ntmp_obj_val: The objective value of a new (temporary) solution.\nobj_val: The objective value of the current solution. temperature: The current temperature in the simulated annealing process, which controls how likely the algorithm is to accept worse solutions.\nA random number r between 0 and 1 is generated. This represents a threshold for whether the new solution will be accepted using random.rand()\nThe probability p of accepting the new solution is computed using the exponential function.\nIf the random value r is less than the calculated probability p, the function returns True, meaning the new solution is accepted (even if it’s worse). If r is greater than p, the new solution is rejected, and the current solution is maintained.\n\nThe function decides whether to accept a new solution in simulated annealing, balancing exploration and exploitation based on the temperature and objective values of the solutions. The np.exp() function ensures that worse solutions have a chance to be accepted, particularly early in the process, fostering a broader search space.\n\n\n# Simulated annealing temperature decay\ndef determine(self, tmp_obj_val, obj_val, temperature):\n     r = np.random.rand()\n     p = np.exp((tmp_obj_val - obj_val) / temperature)\n     return r &lt; p",

This is a common Python convention that improves readability by making intent explicit. Similarly, you will see many programs and function definitions where unused parameters are replaced with an underscore (for example, def handler(_, value):), indicating that a particular argument is intentionally ignored. These small stylistic choices communicate purpose and clarity to anyone reading the code.See the table below for some direct uses of the underscore.\n\n\n\n\nCommon Uses of the Underscore in Python\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPattern\nExample\nCommon.Use.in.Python\n\n\n\n\nSingle underscore: “ignore.”\nfor _ in range(10):\nUsed as a throwaway variable when the value isn’t needed. In the REPL, _ also stores the last result.\n\n\nSingle underscore: “internal.”\n_helper_function()\nMarks a variable or function as internal use only within a module or class (not imported with *).\n\n\nDouble underscore: “private inside a class.”\nself.__secret\nUsed for name mangling inside classes to make attributes harder to access from outside.\n\n\nDouble before & after: “special built-in behavior.”\nif name == ‘main’:\nCommon structure to run code only when the file is executed directly, not when it’s imported as a module.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith Numpy\n\nIn contrast, the NumPy-based implementation below leverages vectorized operations. NumPy handles the entire computation in a single step using efficient, low-level C routines optimized for performance. For example:\n\nThe entire random sample generation is done in one call (np.random.standard_normal(1000000)).\n\n\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport time \n\n# Initial stock price\nS0 = 100 \n\n# Risk-free rate\nr = 0.05 \n\n# Time horizon (1 year)\nT = 1.0 \n\n# Volatility\nsigma = 0.2 \n\n# Start tracking wall time\nstart_time = time.time()\n\nST = S0 * np.exp((r - 0.5 * sigma ** 2) * T +\n    sigma * np.random.standard_normal(1000000) * np.sqrt(T))\n\n# End tracking wall time\nend_time = time.time()\n\n# Calculate time difference\nwall_time = end_time - start_time\n\n# Print timing information\nprint(f\"Wall time: {wall_time:.2f} s\")\n\nWall time: 0.02 s\n\n\n\nMathematical operations like exp and sqrt are applied to entire arrays at once. These optimizations significantly reduce the wall time, as the process avoids Python-level overhead and directly utilizes optimized native code. As a result, the NumPy implementation is typically faster, making it better suited for tasks requiring a high volume of computations.",

The fitness function is used to evaluate the quality of each candidate solution in the population.\nFitness Function: Imagine life had a personal ‘fitness function’ just for you. What variables would you include in it, and how would you weigh them? If 0 meant that you were unable to satisfy that goal, and 1 meant that you were able to satisfy that goal, wouldn’t you want all 1s.\n\n\nOne Max Formula\n\nBinary String: A binary string is generated using NumPy’s randint function, which creates a list of 0s and 1s.\nFitness Function: The one_max function calculates the “fitness” of the binary string, which is simply the sum of all 1s in the string. This is the value that needs to be maximized.\nExample Run: If the generated binary string is [1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0], the fitness would be 6, since there are six 1s in the string.\nThe objective is to maximize the number of 1s in a binary string.\n\n\\[\\max_{s \\in A} f(s) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} s_i, \\quad \\text{subject to} \\ s_i \\in \\{0, 1\\}.\\]\n\n\nOptimal Solution OneMax\n\nThe optimal solution of this problem is that all the subsolutions assume the value 1; i.e., \\(s_i=1\\) for all \\(i\\).

In other words, given a solution, it is possible to check if it is correct relatively quickly (in polynomial time). However, finding the solution itself might take much longer (potentially exponential time) unless the problem can also be solved in polynomial time.\nNP-complete refers to a class of problems in computational complexity theory that are both NP (nondeterministic polynomial time) and every problem in NP can be reduced to it in polynomial time\nNP-hard problems are optimization or decision problems that are at least as difficult to solve as the hardest problems in NP (nondeterministic polynomial time).\n\nUnlike NP-complete problems, NP-hard problems do not have to be verifiable in polynomial time. This means that while it may be incredibly hard to find an optimal solution, even verifying a proposed solution might take more than polynomial time.\nEssentially, NP-hard problems are hard to solve optimally, and their complexity often prevents efficient algorithms from finding or checking solutions within a reasonable time frame.\nNP-hard problems are broader and potentially harder than NP-complete problems because they can include problems that aren’t even in NP. They may not have a polynomial-time verification process.\n\n\n\n\nKey Characteristics of NP-complete Problems\n\nDifficult to solve: No known algorithms can solve NP-complete problems efficiently (in polynomial time) for all instances.\nVerification in polynomial time: If someone provides a solution, it can be verified quickly. Equivalence to other NP-complete problems: If one NP-complete problem can be solved in polynomial time, all NP-complete problems can be solved in polynomial time.\nKnapsack Problem: The 0/1 knapsack problem is NP-complete. Finding the optimal solution is hard, but verifying if a solution meets the constraints and maximizes value can be done in polynomial time.\nThe Fractional knapsack problem is not NP-complete and can be solved in polynomial time using a greedy algorithm.\nThe Travelling Salesman is a NP-hard problem.\n\n\n\nExample Fractional Knapsack Problem\n\nItems Available: - Item 1: Value = 10, Weight = 5 kg - Item 2: Value = 40, Weight = 10 kg - Item 3: Value = 30, Weight = 15 kg\nObjective: Maximize the total value without exceeding Knapsack Capacity of 15 kg.\nThe greedy algorithm works well by prioritizing items with the highest value-to-weight ratio.\n0/1 Knapsack Problem requires more complex algorithms like dynamic programming to find the optimal solution over the Fractional Knapsack Problem\n\n\n\nGreedy Algorithm for Fractional Knapsack\n\nStep 1: Calculate Value-to-Weight Ratio:\n\nItem 1: 10/5=2\nItem 2: 40/10=4\nItem 3: 30/15=2\n\nStep 2: Sort Items by Ratio (Descending): Item 2, Item 1, Item 3\n\nStep 3: Fill the Knapsack:\nTake Item 2 (10 kg, Value = 40).\nTake as much of Item 1 as possible (5 kg, Value = 10).\n\nResults: Total Weight = 15 kg, Total Value = 50.",

It is characterized by its multi-modal nature with a nearly flat outer region and a large hole at the center.\nApplications\n\nUsed as a standard test case in evaluating the performance of optimization algorithms like genetic algorithms, simulated annealing, and particle swarm optimization.\nRelevant in fields such as machine learning, control systems, and operations research.\n\nLimitations\n\nThe function’s large search space and numerous local minima make it difficult for algorithms to converge to the global minimum.\nLarge importance of balancing exploration and exploitation in optimization strategies when dealing with the Ackley Function.\n\n\n\nExplanation of Ackley Function(x, y)\n\nComputes the value of the Ackley function given a point (x, y) in the search space.\nThe optimization algorithm optimizes the Ackley function to find the point where it reaches its minimum. It initializes a population of random solutions, evaluates their fitness (using the Ackley function), and iteratively improves them using an optimization method (like gradient descent or a genetic algorithm).\nThe best solution and corresponding function value (score) are returned as the result.\n\n\n\nAckley function and B2D: Converting to Decimal\n\nThe Ackley function uses the binary representation, where the binary strings need to be converted to decimal values (i.e., real numbers). In this case, the converted decimal values correspond to points in the continuous search space.\nFor example, a binary string like 1010 can be converted into a decimal value, which can then be used as input to the Ackley function. Binary String: 1010, where the binary number is 1010_2.\nEach position in the binary number represents a power of 2, starting from the right (least significant bit):\nThe rightmost bit (0) is \\(2^0\\),The next bit (1) is \\(2^1\\) ,The next bit (0) is \\(2^2\\),The leftmost bit (1) is \\(2^3\\).\n\n\\(1010_2= 0 ∗ 2^0+ 1 ∗ 2^1 +0 ∗ 2^2+1 ∗ 2^3\\) \\(= 0 ∗ 1+ 1 ∗ 2 + 0 ∗ 4 + 1 ∗ 8\\) \\(=  0 + 2 + 0 + 8 = 10\\) Thus, the decimal equivalent of the binary string “1010” is 10. Use this value as input for the Ackley function.\n\n\nCharacteristics and Visualization of Ackley Function\n\nThe Ackley function is evaluated in the hypercube.\nThe global optimum (minimum) of the Ackley function is 𝑓(𝑠^∗)=0 is located at \\(s^*=(0,0,…0)\\).\nThis function has many local optima, which makes it hard for the search algorithm to find the global optimum.\n\n\n\n\nAckley\n\n\n\n\nAckley Function Formula\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{rl}\n\\min_{s \\in \\mathbb{R}^n} f(s) &= -20 \\exp \\left(-0.2 \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n s_i^2} \\right) \\\\\n& \\quad - \\exp \\left( \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\cos(2 \\pi s_i) \\right) + 20 + e, \\\\\n\\text{subject to} & \\quad -30 \\leq s_i \\leq 30, \\quad i = 1, 2, \\dots, n.\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\n\nAckley Function: Pseudocode\n\nThe below example uses a random function to pull a point that we want to hit the local minima.

These results are random, so it may vary from what you see in the plot.\nDistance from the Origin: The Ackley function reaches its global minimum of 0 at the origin (i.e., when both \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\) are close to 0). Our vector values are quite far from the origin, which is why the function result is positive and relatively large at 17.9”\nThe Ackley landscape has an exponentially increasing structure as you move away from the global minimum. It has many local minima, which makes optimization algorithms prone to getting stuck in suboptimal solutions. A result like 17.9 is far from zero, and indicates that the vector is located in such a suboptimal region of the function space.\nThus, the Ackley result of 17.9 suggests that the point [12.8 3.16]; is not close to the global minimum (which is zero at the origin) and is located in a region of higher function values.\n\n\n\nDifferential Evolution with the Ackley Function\n\nTo demonstrate how an algorithm does well on the Ackley function, we can use a global optimization algorithm such as Differential Evolution, which is effective for non-convex functions with many local minima.\nDifferential Evolution is a population-based optimization algorithm used for solving complex multidimensional problems. It belongs to the family of evolutionary algorithms, where a population of candidate solutions evolves over time to find the global optimum of a function.\nThe differential_evolution function from the scipy.optimize module is a powerful optimization tool designed to solve global optimization problems. It is a type of evolutionary algorithm, which is used when the function to optimize is non-linear, has many local minima, or is not differentiable.\n\n\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import differential_evolution\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nnp.random.seed(5042)\n\n# Define the Ackley function\n# Ackley function implementation\ndef ackley(s):\n    a, b, c = 20, 0.2, 2 * np.pi\n    n = len(s)\n    sum_sq_term = np.sum(s**2)\n    cos_term = np.sum(np.cos(c * s))\n    term1 = -a * np.exp(-b * np.sqrt(sum_sq_term / n))\n    term2 = -np.exp(cos_term / n)\n    return term1 + term2 + a + np.e\n\n# Set the bounds for the variables \nbounds = [(-30, 30), (-30, 30)]\n\n# Use differential evolution to minimize the Ackley function\nresult = differential_evolution(ackley, bounds, seed=42)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(f'Optimized parameters (x1, x2): {result.x}')\nprint(f'Function value at minimum: {result.fun}')\n\n\n# Visualization of the Ackley function\nx = np.linspace(-30, 30, 400)\ny = np.linspace(-30, 30, 400)\nX, Y = np.meshgrid(x, y)\n\n# Compute Z for the Ackley function\nZ = np.array([ackley(np.array([x_val, y_val])) for x_val, y_val in zip(np.ravel(X), np.ravel(Y))])\nZ = Z.reshape(X.shape)\n\n# Plotting the Ackley function surface\nfig = plt.figure(figsize=(10, 7))\nax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection='3d')\nax.plot_surface(X, Y, Z, cmap='viridis', edgecolor='none')\n\n# Customize the plot\nax.set_title(\"Ackley Function Surface (2D)\")\nax.set_xlabel(\"s_1\")\nax.set_ylabel(\"s_2\")\nax.set_zlabel(\"f(s)\")\n\n# Show the plot\nplt.show()\n\nOptimized parameters (x1, x2): [0. 0.]\nFunction value at minimum: 4.440892098500626e-16\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing a great function that is designed to solve problems with multiple local minimums, you can see that we got extremely close to the local minimum 0.",

    "text": "Multi-objective Optimization Problem (MOP)\n\nGiven a set of functions and a set of constraints, the MOP is to find the optimal value or a set of optimal values (also called Pareto front), subject to the constraints, out of all possible solutions of these functions.\nThe Pareto front consists of solutions where no objective can be improved without worsening at least one other objective. For example, In product design, you might want to minimize cost while maximizing performance. These two objectives are often in conflict, meaning improving one leads to trade-offs in the other.\n\n\\[\\text{opt}\\left( f_1(s), f_2(s), \\dots, f_k(s) \\right),\n\\quad \\mathbf{s} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n,\n\\quad \\text{subject to } c_i(s) \\odot b_i, \\quad i = 1, 2, \\dots, m,\\]\n\nWhere\n\n\\({R}^n\\) and \\({R}\\) are the domain and codomain, respectively,\n\\(f(s) {R}^n\\) and \\({R}\\) is the objective function to be optimized,\n\\(c_i(s): {R}^n\\) and \\({R}\\odot b_i, \\quad i = 1, 2, \\ldots, m,\\) are the constraints,\nand \\(opt\\) and \\(\\odot\\) are as given in Definition 1 as &lt;, &gt;, =, ⩽, or ⩾.\n\n\n\nThe Schaffer min-min Multi-objective Optimization Problem\n\nThe Schaffer min-min problem is a well-known test function in the field of multi-objective optimization.\nIt is often used to evaluate optimization algorithms due to its simplicity and well-defined structure. The problem is particularly famous for having a simple Pareto-optimal front.\nThe Schaffer function can be defined as a two-objective optimization problem, where the objectives are functions of a single variable x.\nThe goal is to minimize both of these objective functions simultaneously.\n\n\nCharacteristics and Visualization\n\nConvexity: The Pareto front of the Schaffer min-min problem is convex, making it relatively easy to identify the trade-off surface between the two objectives.\nGraphically, the Pareto front of the Schaffer min-min problem can be visualized as a curve in the objective space, where \\(f_1(x)\\) is plotted against \\(f_2(x)\\) and the curve represents the set of optimal trade-offs between the two objectives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nscipy.optimize import minimize\n\nminimize is a general-purpose function from scipy.optimize used for finding the minimum of a scalar function.\nUses the BFGS (Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno) algorithm when no specific method is provided. This method is a quasi-Newton optimization algorithm, particularly useful for smooth unconstrained problems.\n\nIt can handle different types of optimization problems, including: Unconstrained minimization\nConstrained minimization (equality and inequality constraints) Bounded minimization (where variables are limited to a certain range)\n\nBasic Workflow:\n\nDefine the objective function (the function to minimize). Choose an initial guess for the variables.\nRun the minimize function with the desired method.\nAnalyze the results: returns optimized variables, the function value, and other diagnostic information.\n\n\n\n\nSchaffer Min-Min Formula\n\\[\n\\min_{s \\in \\mathbb{R}^n}\n\\begin{cases}\nf_1(s) = s^2, \\\\\nf_2(s) = (s - 2)^2,\n\\end{cases}\n\\quad \\text{subject to} \\quad s \\in [-10^3, 10^3].\n\\]\n\n\nSchaffer Min-Min Pseudocode\nPseudocode\n\n# FUNCTION to calculate f1(s)\nFUNCTION f1(s):\n    RETURN s^2\n\n# FUNCTION to calculate f2(s)\nFUNCTION f2(s):\n    RETURN (s - 2)^2\n\n# FUNCTION for combined objective, weighted sum of f1 and f2\nFUNCTION combined_objective(s, w1=0.5, w2=0.5):\n    RETURN w1 * f1(s) + w2 * f2(s)\n\n# MAIN EXECUTION\n# Step 1: Set up the bounds for the solution (s ∈ [-1000, 1000])\nSET bounds = [-1000, 1000]\n\n# Step 2: Initialize a starting guess for the solution\nSET initial_guess = 0\n\n# Step 3: Minimize the combined objective function using an optimization algorithm\nCALL minimize function with combined_objective, initial_guess, and bounds\nSTORE the result in result\n\n# Step 4: Print the optimization result\nPRINT \"Optimal value of s:\", result.x\nPRINT \"f1(s):\", f1(result.x)\nPRINT \"f2(s):\", f2(result.x)\nPRINT \"Combined objective:\", combined_objective(result.x)\n\n# Step 5: Visualization - Create a range of values for s from -1000 to 1000\n\n\n\nSchaffer Min-Min Python Implementation\n\nPopulation Initialization: A population of random solutions is initialized within the bounds [−1000,1000]. Objective Function Evaluation: For each solution, both objective functions are evaluated.\nScore Combination: The results of the two functions are combined into a single score, which can be minimized. In this case, the combination is a simple sum of f1 and f2.\nOptimization Loop: Iteratively updates the solutions to find the minimum combined score using an optimization technique (e.g., gradient descent, genetic algorithm).\nThe plot uses the weighted sum minimization, w1 * f1(s) + w2 * f2(s) instead of plotting the Pareto front. The plot prints The optimal \\(s\\) value and the corresponding function values \\(f1(s)\\) and \\(f2(s)\\) at that point.

For \\(2^n\\) possible combinations. So, by setting the number of bits, you are effectively defining the boundaries of the search space.\nEnumerating All Possibilities: In exhaustive search, the algorithm needs to evaluate every possible configuration to ensure the optimal solution is found. Each unique binary string corresponds to a specific candidate solution, so having the number of bits set enables the algorithm to enumerate all possible configurations.\nComputational Complexity: The number of bits directly affects the computational complexity of exhaustive search.

    "text": "Items To Consider\n\nA Sharpe ratio of 2.800 is very good, suggesting that the portfolio has a favorable balance of return vs. risk. This ratio indicates that for each unit of risk, your portfolio earns more than two times the return.\nWhether this Sharpe ratio is truly impressive depends on the quality and volatility of the returns in the dataset. Financial markets rarely produce consistently high Sharpe ratios, so the high value might indicate the presence of some anomaly, or it could be due to a limited timeframe or low volatility in the assets during this period.\nGiven the high concentration in a few stocks, there’s a risk that the algorithm might be overfitting to the specific data in the training period. This means the portfolio might perform very well during the period used for the analysis but might not generalize well to future periods.\nThings to Try Next:\n\nBacktesting: Test this portfolio over a different time period or a longer time horizon to see if it maintains its high Sharpe ratio.\nRebalancing: Consider rebalancing the portfolio periodically (monthly or quarterly) to see if the high Sharpe ratio persists.\nDiversification: If you are concerned about high concentration risk, you might want to introduce constraints to the hill climbing algorithm to enforce a minimum weight for diversification or limit the maximum weight of any asset.",

    "text": "History of Metaheuristics\n\nAlthough the term “metaheuristic” was introduced in the 1980s, several metaheuristic algorithms were actually presented in the 1960s or even earlier.\nThe year 1990 can be regarded as the first watershed in the development of metaheuristic algorithms. However, the available computing power may not satisfy the requirements of some complicated metaheuristic algorithms.\nSince the late 1990s, the number of metaheuristic algorithms has exploded. More and more studies use “the number of evaluations” to replace “the number of iterations” for evaluating the performance of a metaheuristic algorithm because each search can be regarded as an investment of computation resource.\n\nUsing the number of evaluations provides a way that is more precise than using the number of iterations to evaluate the effect (improvement or outcome) of adding an additional unit of computation resource for the search\n\nFrom the year 2010 or even earlier, some groups have attempted to apply metaheuristic algorithms in high-performance computing environments.\n\nUsing distributed or parallel computing systems to accelerate the response time of metaheuristic algorithms is an intuitive approach adopted in some early studies.\nSome of the parallel metaheuristics are not only able to provide the end results to the user more quickly; they also can find better results than metaheuristic algorithms on a single machine because the parallel computing mechanism leads them to increase the search diversity during the convergence process.\nWhen we look at these distributed and parallel computing environments, the cloud computing platform (e.g., Hadoop, Spark, Microsoft Azure, Amazon EC2, or Google Compute Engine) can now provide an easy way to use a distributed computing system to further reduce the response time of metaheuristics.",

    "text": "UFM 5 Main Operators\n\nInitialization (I): The initialization operator normally plays the roles of reading the input file (e.g., dataset), initializing all the parameters of a metaheuristic algorithm, and determining the initial solutions, which is normally based on a random process.\nTransition (T): The transition operator usually plays the role of varying the search directions, such as perturbing a portion of the subsolutions of the current solution to generate a new candidate solution or generating a set of new candidate solutions each based on two or more of the current solutions.\nEvaluation (E): The evaluation operator is responsible for measuring the quality of solutions, such as calculating the objective value of each solution to be used by the determination operator to distinguish the quality of all the solutions. An intuitive way is to use an objective function to measure the quality of a solution for the problem in question. However, some metaheuristics do not use the “objective value” directly to measure their solutions; rather, the objective value of a solution has to undergo some sort of transformation to obtain the so-called “fitness value.”\nDetermination (D): The determination operator plays the role of deciding the search directions by using information the evaluation operator provides during the convergence process. The performance of a metaheuristic algorithm depends to a large extent on the performance of this operator. A “good” search strategy for this operator will make it possible for the metaheuristic algorithm to find a better solution faster or to avoid falling into a local optimum at early iterations.\nOutput (O): In spite of the fact that this operator seems to be trivial, the reality is that it can be either simple or complex depending on how much information we want to display for the metaheuristic algorithm. It can be as simple as displaying only the final result of the metaheuristic algorithm, or it can be as complex as displaying the trajectory of convergence of the metaheuristic algorithm to better understand the performance of a metaheuristic algorithm.",

If the search starts at \\(x_9\\), SA can potentially move to worse solutions with a certain probability based on temperature and a random probability check. At higher temperatures, SA has a higher chance of escaping local optima (\\(L_1\\)) (\\(x_8\\)) and (\\(L_2\\)) (\\(x_{10}\\)), but as the temperature decreases, it becomes less likely to accept worse moves, leading to convergence.\n\n\n\n\nSearch Strategy of SA",

    "text": "Comparing Algorithms\n\nSimulated Annealing Algorithms\n\nExploration: In the early stages, SA accepts worse solutions with high probability, which allows it to explore the search space more broadly and escape local optima.\nExploitation: As the temperature decreases, the algorithm becomes more conservative and starts focusing on refining the current solution. SA balances exploration and exploitation dynamically as the temperature cools.\nTrade-off: SA is particularly good when the solution space is rugged (many local optima) because it has a built-in mechanism (temperature) to transition from exploration to exploitation.\n\nGenetic Algorithms\n\nExploration: GA uses processes like mutation and crossover to generate new solutions from the current population. Mutation allows for exploration by introducing random changes, while crossover exploits good solutions by combining them.\nExploitation: GA exploits the best solutions through selection and crossover, where solutions with higher fitness are more likely to survive and reproduce.\nTrade-off: GA maintains a population of solutions, which helps with exploration, but can sometimes suffer from premature convergence if the population becomes too homogeneous, leading to poor exploitation of potentially better solutions.\n\nGreedy Algorithms\n\nExploration: Greedy algorithms have very limited exploration. They make the best immediate choice (locally optimal) at each step without considering the broader solution space.\nExploitation: Greedy heuristics are purely exploitative—they focus solely on improving the current state as much as possible. They tend to get stuck in local optima because they don’t explore alternative solutions that might initially look worse but could lead to better outcomes.\nTrade-off: A greedy algorithm doesn’t balance exploration and exploitation well. It is fast and simple but can fail when the problem has many local optima, making it inappropriate for complex problems like TSP or scheduling.\n\n\n\nWhen SA Is More Appropriate\n\nRugged Solution Spaces: When there are many local optima (like in the Ackley function or complex scheduling), SA’s ability to accept worse solutions helps it explore more and avoid local traps.\nTime-Constrained Search: SA can be more useful when you don’t need an exact global optimum but want a good solution within a reasonable amount of time. The cooling schedule can be adjusted to control how fast the algorithm converges.",

Each evaluation represents one step in the simulated annealing process.\nA neighboring solution (neighbor_sol) is generated by the transit function, which randomly flips one bit in the current solution.\nThis represents exploring a new area of the search space close to the current solution.\nThe neighboring solution is evaluated using the evaluate function, which calculates its fitness (i.e., the number of 1’s in the binary array). This value is compared to the current solution’s fitness.\nThe determine function decides whether to accept the neighboring solution\nThe current solution’s fitness is appended to value_history to keep a record of the solution’s fitness across evaluations. This will later be used to plot the progress of the algorithm.\nAfter each evaluation, the temperature is reduced by multiplying it by the cooling_rate (default 0.99). This cooling process gradually reduces the probability of accepting worse solutions, making the algorithm behave more like greedy hill climbing toward the end.\nThe number of evals is incremented.\nAfter the loop terminates (either because the temperature has cooled sufficiently or the maximum number of evaluations has been reached), the function returns: 1) best_sol: The best solution found during the process. 2) best_value: The fitness value of the best solution. 3) value_history: A list of the fitness values over time, useful for visualizing the algorithm’s progress.\n\n\n# Simulated Annealing (SA) function\ndef simulated_annealing(num_bits):\n    current_sol, current_value = init_sa(num_bits)\n    best_sol, best_value = current_sol, current_value\n    temperature = initial_temp\n    value_history = [current_value]\n\n    evals = 0\n    while temperature &gt; min_temp and evals &lt; max_evals:\n        neighbor_sol = transit(current_sol)\n        neighbor_value = evaluate(neighbor_sol)\n\n        if determine(neighbor_value, current_value, temperature):\n            current_sol, current_value = neighbor_sol, neighbor_value\n            if current_value &gt; best_value:\n                best_sol, best_value = current_sol, current_value\n\n        # Store history of values for plotting\n        value_history.append(current_value)\n\n        # Cool down the temperature\n        temperature *= cooling_rate\n        evals += 1\n\n    return best_sol, best_value, value_history\n\n\n\n\nExample Cooling Schedule Calculations\n\n\n\n\nMain Execution\n\nThe process starts by initializing the solution using Initialization (I) (init_sa), followed by repeated transitions (T) and evaluations (E) to explore the search space.\nAfter each transition, the Determination (D) function decides whether to accept the new solution based on the current temperature and fitness values.\nThe temperature gradually cools down, reducing the chance of accepting worse solutions as the algorithm progresses.\nFinally, the results are printed and plotted for visual analysis.\n\n\n# Main execution\nstart_time = time.time()\nbest_sol, best_value, value_history = simulated_annealing(num_bits)\nend_time = time.time()\nexecution_time = end_time - start_time",

The value 0.0025805153299995887 is very close to this, showing that the algorithm successfully minimized the function but did not reach the exact minimum. This small difference can be due to the stochastic nature of simulated annealing and the stopping criteria (temperature and iterations).\n\nExecution time: 0.012161 seconds\n\nThis indicates the total time it took for the simulated annealing algorithm to run and find the optimal solution.\nThe process completed in just 0.012 seconds, which is very fast. This fast execution time suggests that the algorithm quickly converged to a near-optimal solution, likely because the problem space (1D) is simple and small, and the Ackley function’s shape guides the algorithm efficiently toward the global minimum.\n\n\n\nComparing SA to HC with Ackley Function\n\nIn an example run, I found the following results depicted in the png image below. The simulated annealing algorithm performed well, finding a solution very close to the global minimum of the Ackley function in a short time.\nThe slight deviation from the exact minimum value (0) is expected due to the stochastic exploration nature of simulated annealing. You can compare these results to the ones above under a different set seed.\n\n\n\n\nComparing HA with Ackley\n\n\n\nOur SA model was much better than our HC model with the Ackley Function. Why?\n\nThe Ackley function is known for its multimodal landscape—it has many local minima and a global minimum at 𝑥=0. The landscape consists of a broad plateau followed by sharp drops toward the global minimum, making it challenging for optimization algorithms to find the true global minimum.\nHill climbing can get stuck in one of the many local minima because it only moves to a better neighboring solution. Once it reaches a local minimum, it can’t escape because no better solution is immediately available in its neighborhood.\nSimulated annealing, by contrast, has the ability to accept worse solutions early in the process, which allows it to escape local minima and continue searching for the global minimum.",

    "text": "Our Hill Climbing Finance Model was Better. Why?\n\nHill Climbing\n\nDeterministic: In each iteration, the algorithm strictly accepts a new portfolio only if it improves the Sharpe ratio (a measure of risk-adjusted returns). There’s no acceptance of worse solutions.\nThis results in a steady and consistent increase in the Sharpe ratio because the model always moves toward better solutions without exploring worse ones.\nSince hill climbing is greedy and deterministic, it focuses on continuously improving the portfolio weights in a direct manner, which can be more efficient for problems where the optimization landscape is relatively smooth or doesn’t have too many local minima.\n\nSimulated Annealing:\n\nStochastic Exploration: Simulated annealing, on the other hand, allows for the acceptance of worse solutions, especially early in the process when the temperature is high. This stochastic exploration helps to avoid getting stuck in local minima, but it can sometimes lead to suboptimal moves that temporarily reduce performance.\nSA slowly improves the Sharpe ratio by lowering the temperature and becoming more selective over time. However, this can result in slower convergence compared to hill climbing, which directly improves the Sharpe ratio with each iteration.\nWhile simulated annealing balances exploration and exploitation, its performance might be slightly worse in this case because it explores a broader range of solutions, some of which may be worse. The stochastic nature may cause delays in reaching the global optimum in cases where the optimization problem is less prone to getting stuck in local minima.",

The fitness values of all the chromosomes will also be calculated by the selection operator.\nOnce the parents are selected by the selection operator, the crossover and mutation operators are used to generate a new population \\(v\\), which is called the offspring of the parents \\(s’\\).\nThe offspring at iteration \\(t\\) will become the current population s of iteration \\(t+1\\). This is referred to as the reproduction process.\n\n\n\n\nGenetic Algorithm\n\n\n\nThe strategies of the selection, crossover, and mutation operators of GA: (a) using only the selection operator and (b) using all the three operators.\nGA will first randomly select some of the chromosomes based on the fitness value of each chromosome.\nShows the situation in which only the selection operator is used, i.e., no other transition operators are used. In this case, the distribution of all the chromosomes will be shifted and changed from left to right on the x-axis from generation t=1 to generation t=3.\nThis means that the average objective value of the population will be increased while the variance is decreased. If GA uses only the selection operator but none of the transition operators (e.g., crossover or mutation), it will not generate any new candidate solutions even though the average objective value of all the chromosomes is raised from 1.5 to 2.5.\nShows that if GA uses not only the selection operator to select better chromosomes for the next generation but also the crossover and mutation operators as the transition operators to generate new chromosomes for the population, this makes it possible for GA to find better candidate solutions. In this example, the average objective value of all the chromosomes will be increased from 1.5 to 3, while the best objective value will exceed 3.\n\n\n\n\nGenetic Algorithm\n\n\n\nThe strategy of the transition operator of GA.

    "section": "Comparing GA to SA",
    "text": "Comparing GA to SA\n\nMultiple search directions: Compared to the single-solution-based metaheuristic algorithms (e.g., SA) that search only one solution at a time, GA searches for more than one solution at a time during the convergence process. Since GA will search for multiple directions or regions at a time, its search diversity will normally be much higher than single-solution-based metaheuristics that search for only one direction or region at a time during the convergence process. Selection operator: Another characteristic of GA is that it uses the selection and fitness function operators to determine solutions to be searched, not just based on the objective value of each solution. This kind of mechanism keeps the search process of GA from looking for the best solution in the population all the time so that it will not always choose the solution with the best objective or fitness value to search its neighbors again and again. Consequently, GA will not easily get stuck in local optima at early iterations.\nCrossover operator: This operator is one of the transition operators of GA, which plays the role of exchanging information between parent chromosomes, such as moving portions of the genes of a chromosome to another. This kind of mechanism allows GA to restructure its solutions to form new solutions in such a way that the structure of the new solutions is not confined to the structure of the initial solutions and may even inherit partial structures from their parents; as a consequence, the search process of GA will quickly jump from one region to another in the solution space during the convergence process.\nMutation operator: This operator is another transition operator of GA, which ensures that the search process of GA is capable of escaping from a local optimum by changing the value of some genes randomly. Of course, this kind of mechanism will also play the role of fine-tuning the chromosomes of GA because only a few genes will be changed at a time.",

    "text": "Transition (T): Crossover Function\n\nIn genetic algorithms, the transition function refers to the combined operations of crossover and mutation that generate a new population (offspring) from the current population. The transition function first applies crossover to exchange genetic material between selected parent solutions, creating new offspring, and then applies mutation to introduce small random changes in the offspring, maintaining diversity and enabling exploration of the solution space. This ensures a balance between exploitation of good solutions (via crossover) and exploration of new solutions (via mutation).\nCrossover: Pairs of solutions from the selected population are combined to create new offspring by mixing parts of the parent solutions.\nA new population (new_pop) is initialized as a copy of the current population (pop). The loop iterates over the population in pairs. For each pair, a random number is generated using np.random.rand(). If this number is less than the crossover_rate, crossover occurs:\n\nA crossover point is chosen randomly (here, using np.random.randint(0, pop.shape[1]), which specifies where the two parent solutions will exchange segments. The segments of the two parent solutions from the crossover point onward are swapped, creating two new offspring solutions.\nIf the random number is greater than the crossover_rate, no crossover occurs, and the parent solutions remain unchanged.

Beginning with a broad overview, we highlight the significance of algorithms in diverse industries and introduce foundational heuristic methods, emphasizing their value for complex problem-solving where traditional approaches fall short due to scalability or computational limits: (1Intro), (2Algorithms), (3NumpyBasics).\nThe content progresses through various algorithm types: constructive methods like greedy algorithms, exhaustive search, and iterative improvement approaches, including hill climbing. Key concepts like local optima, plateaus, and ridges are explained alongside examples such as the Knapsack Problem and Traveling Salesman Problem, laying a foundation for understanding optimization challenges and strategies for improving solutions iteratively: (4Greedy); (6ExhaustiveSearch); and (7HillClimbing).\nThe later course material delves into advanced metaheuristic algorithms, specifically Simulated Annealing (SA) and Genetic Algorithms (GA). SA is explained with its cooling schedule and probabilistic acceptance of suboptimal solutions, which help avoid local optima. GA is described through its evolutionary process—selection, crossover, and mutation—illustrating how populations of solutions evolve toward optimality over generations.\nThe advantages and disadvantages of each approach are covered, along with the importance of tuning parameters for effective convergence. This framework not only familiarizes students with the mechanics of each method but also stresses the trade-offs involved, preparing them to apply these techniques to benchmark problems such as the Ackley and OneMax functions: (5BenchmarkProblems); (8-9SimulatedAnnealing); and (10-11GeneticAlgorithms)",

Alas! That did not happen. After five years I did regain some optimism because the book did not “die,” as is usual with monographs, but kept on selling at 100–200 copies a year. Still, research in the area was confined almost entirely to my students and their colleagues, and it did not fit into anyone’s categories\n\nWhere John H.
