        "\n",
        "-   One of the main attributes of a metaheuristic algorithm is that it performs a certain set of operators for a certain number of iterations to search for the optimal solution with great shrewdness.\n",
        "-   Compared to the Exhaustive Search (ES) and hill climbing (HC) algorithms, a metaheuristic algorithm will neither check all the candidate solutions of a complex optimization problem like ES nor fall into a local optimum at early iterations as easily as HC.\n",
        "\n",
        "## History of Metaheuristics\n",
        "\n",
        "-   Although the term “metaheuristic” was introduced in the 1980s, several metaheuristic algorithms were actually presented in the 1960s or even earlier.\n",
        "-   The year 1990 can be regarded as the first watershed in the development of metaheuristic algorithms. However, the available computing power may not satisfy the requirements of some complicated metaheuristic algorithms.\n",
        "-   Since the late 1990s, the number of metaheuristic algorithms has exploded. More and more studies use “the number of evaluations” to replace “the number of iterations” for evaluating the performance of a metaheuristic algorithm because each search can be regarded as an investment of computation resource.\n",
        "    -   Using the number of evaluations provides a way that is more precise than using the number of iterations to evaluate the effect (improvement or outcome) of adding an additional unit of computation resource for the search\n",
        "-   From the year 2010 or even earlier, some groups have attempted to apply metaheuristic algorithms in high-performance computing environments.\n",
        "    -   Using distributed or parallel computing systems to accelerate the response time of metaheuristic algorithms is an intuitive approach adopted in some early studies.\n",
        "    -   Some of the parallel metaheuristics are not only able to provide the end results to the user more quickly; they also can find better results than metaheuristic algorithms on a single machine because the parallel computing mechanism leads them to increase the search diversity during the convergence process.\n",
        "    -   When we look at these distributed and parallel computing environments, the cloud computing platform (e.g., Hadoop, Spark, Microsoft Azure, Amazon EC2, or Google Compute Engine) can now provide an easy way to use a distributed computing system to further reduce the response time of metaheuristics.\n",
        "\n",
        "## A Unified Framework for Metaheuristic Algorithms (UFM)\n",
        "\n",
        "-   The appearance of metaheuristic algorithms has come with methods to classify them. These classification methods include:\n",
        "\n",
        "(1) nature-inspired vs. non-nature inspired,\n",
        "(2) dynamic vs. static objective function,\n",
        "(3) one vs. various neighborhood structures,\n",

        "## UFM 5 Main Operators\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  Initialization (I): The initialization operator normally plays the roles of reading the input file (e.g., dataset), initializing all the parameters of a metaheuristic algorithm, and determining the initial solutions, which is normally based on a random process.\n",
        "2.  Transition (T): The transition operator usually plays the role of varying the search directions, such as perturbing a portion of the subsolutions of the current solution to generate a new candidate solution or generating a set of new candidate solutions each based on two or more of the current solutions.\n",
        "3.  Evaluation (E): The evaluation operator is responsible for measuring the quality of solutions, such as calculating the objective value of each solution to be used by the determination operator to distinguish the quality of all the solutions. An intuitive way is to use an objective function to measure the quality of a solution for the problem in question. However, some metaheuristics do not use the “objective value” directly to measure their solutions; rather, the objective value of a solution has to undergo some sort of transformation to obtain the so-called “fitness value.”\n",
        "4.  Determination (D): The determination operator plays the role of deciding the search directions by using information the evaluation operator provides during the convergence process. The performance of a metaheuristic algorithm depends to a large extent on the performance of this operator. A “good” search strategy for this operator will make it possible for the metaheuristic algorithm to find a better solution faster or to avoid falling into a local optimum at early iterations.\n",
        "5.  Output (O): In spite of the fact that this operator seems to be trivial, the reality is that it can be either simple or complex depending on how much information we want to display for the metaheuristic algorithm. It can be as simple as displaying only the final result of the metaheuristic algorithm, or it can be as complex as displaying the trajectory of convergence of the metaheuristic algorithm to better understand the performance of a metaheuristic algorithm.\n",

        "-   This example shows that if the starting point is 𝑥_9 and SA accepts only a new candidate solution that is better than the current solution, i.e., it has no escape mechanism, the search will get stuck at one of the two local optima ($x_8$ and $x_10$) denoted $L_1$ and $L_2$.\n",
        "-   The temperature parameter in SA allows escape from local optima. If the search starts at $x_9$, SA can potentially move to worse solutions with a certain probability based on temperature and a random probability check. At higher temperatures, SA has a higher chance of escaping local optima ($L_1$) ($x_8$) and ($L_2$) ($x_{10}$), but as the temperature decreases, it becomes less likely to accept worse moves, leading to convergence.\n",

        "-   Our SA model was much better than our HC model with the Ackley Function. Why?\n",
        "    -   The Ackley function is known for its multimodal landscape—it has many local minima and a global minimum at 𝑥=0. The landscape consists of a broad plateau followed by sharp drops toward the global minimum, making it challenging for optimization algorithms to find the true global minimum.\n",
        "    -   Hill climbing can get stuck in one of the many local minima because it only moves to a better neighboring solution. Once it reaches a local minimum, it can't escape because no better solution is immediately available in its neighborhood.\n",
        "    -   Simulated annealing, by contrast, has the ability to accept worse solutions early in the process, which allows it to escape local minima and continue searching for the global minimum.\n",

        "-   Hill Climbing\n",
        "    -   Deterministic: In each iteration, the algorithm strictly accepts a new portfolio only if it improves the Sharpe ratio (a measure of risk-adjusted returns). There’s no acceptance of worse solutions.\n",
        "    -   This results in a steady and consistent increase in the Sharpe ratio because the model always moves toward better solutions without exploring worse ones.\n",
        "    -   Since hill climbing is greedy and deterministic, it focuses on continuously improving the portfolio weights in a direct manner, which can be more efficient for problems where the optimization landscape is relatively smooth or doesn’t have too many local minima.\n",
        "-   Simulated Annealing:\n",
        "    -   Stochastic Exploration: Simulated annealing, on the other hand, allows for the acceptance of worse solutions, especially early in the process when the temperature is high. This stochastic exploration helps to avoid getting stuck in local minima, but it can sometimes lead to suboptimal moves that temporarily reduce performance.\n",
        "    -   SA slowly improves the Sharpe ratio by lowering the temperature and becoming more selective over time. However, this can result in slower convergence compared to hill climbing, which directly improves the Sharpe ratio with each iteration.\n",
        "    -   While simulated annealing balances exploration and exploitation, its performance might be slightly worse in this case because it explores a broader range of solutions, some of which may be worse. The stochastic nature may cause delays in reaching the global optimum in cases where the optimization problem is less prone to getting stuck in local minima.\n",
