As we explore heuristic methods in this MSBA course, having a strong foundation in coding, especially in Python, will allow you to implement and test algorithms efficiently.\n",
        "-   Good coding practices, such as writing clear, modular code and incorporating meaningful comments, are critical for both readability and collaboration. By starting with simple Python examples that highlight these principles, we’ll build the groundwork for more sophisticated modeling tasks, from randomization techniques to optimization algorithms, equipping you with both technical skills and best practices for professional code development.\n",

Procedural programming focuses on structuring code into functions and sequences of instructions, making it straightforward and ideal for simpler tasks or smaller projects. In contrast, OOP organizes code around objects, which encapsulate data and behavior, allowing for greater modularity, reuse, and scalability. \n",
