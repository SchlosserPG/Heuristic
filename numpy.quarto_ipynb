As we explore heuristic methods in this MSBA course, having a strong foundation in coding, especially in Python, will allow you to implement and test algorithms efficiently.\n",

By starting with simple Python examples that highlight these principles, we‚Äôll build the groundwork for more sophisticated modeling tasks, from randomization techniques to optimization algorithms, equipping you with both technical skills and best practices for professional code development.\n",
